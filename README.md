# StSModFasterAscensionClimbing

This is a quality of life mod that allows you to climb ascension levels faster!

With this mod you can change how many ascension levels you climb after a win. This value needs to be set in the mod settings. For example if you set 5, and you win a run on ascension 10, you will unlock ascension 15 straight away.

Additionally this mod lets you set the maximum unlocked ascension level for all characters or for a specified character. 

This mod works with all base game characters as well as all modded characters.
