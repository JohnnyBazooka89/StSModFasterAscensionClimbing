This value needs to be set in the mod settings. For example if you set 5, and you win a run on ascension 10, you will unlock ascension 15 straight away.\n\nAdditionally this mod lets you set the maximum unlocked ascension level for all characters or for a specified character.\n\nThis mod works with all base game characters as well as all modded characters.",
